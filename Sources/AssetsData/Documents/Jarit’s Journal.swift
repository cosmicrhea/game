      SHARDS IN THE BLOOD

      They say it’s a “virus.”
      They say it’s “natural.”
      But glass doesn’t grow inside people.

      Blood tests from 2019 already showed crystalization markers. Nobody asked why.
      
      What if it isn’t disease? What if it’s design?

      THE PHARMA CONNECTION

      Perring Pharma Group. They say they make “harmless supplements.” But check the shipping logs:

      - “Composite cargo”
      - “Cryo samples”
      - “SILICA-LIVING”

      Corporate fronts move products in unmarked trucks at night. Where to?

      MILITARY EXPERIMENTS
      
      1960s NATO memos spoke of “mirror soldiers.” Troops that couldn’t bleed, couldn’t feel pain. Project never officially existed.
      
      But ex-soldiers in Østerbro speak of exercises where recruits “shone in the dark.”

      Coincidence?
      No such thing.

      GLASS PEOPLE AMONG US

      Look close at your neighbors.
      Some of them already have the shine.
      Pale skin, reflective eyes, moving wrong.

      They’re not sick. They’re transmitting.
      You can catch it by standing too close. By trusting the wrong face.

      WHAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW

      The outbreak isn’t the start.
      It’s the harvest.

      Pharma, military, government: they’re all in on it. We are the test subjects. The city is the lab.

      And the cure?
      There is none.
