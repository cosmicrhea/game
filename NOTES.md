# Glass

Glass is a survival horror game for Mac, PC, and consoles. Taking place in Denmark, you play as [Name], an agent for the DDIS.

## Opening Cutscene

Overhead shot of The Citadel. Text typing onto the screen: “DDIS HQ, The Citadel”.

Interior shot of an office. Someone’s on the phone with the PM or the king or something. Gets word of the glass outbreak. Is in disbelief.

**CHIEF**
Yes, your majesty. So it’s real. Yes. I understand, your majesty. Good. We’ll start evacuating and I’ll keep you apprised. Yes. May god help us all.

Slow fade to black.

Overhead shot / fly to: “DDIS Collection Station, ‘The Farm’”.

[Protag] is there for some reason with her work partner. They’re doing some routine thing, bantering about how a clandestine simulation in the city would’ve been more fun. “Nohing rarely happens” kinda vibe. Or at least “It’s been a while since anything’s happened” vibes.

Possibly shot of rows of servers humming, blinking. Then some hallways of The Farm. Voiceover from our protag & partner before we see them.

[Protag] gets a call. Boss wants her to come in immediatley, sounds extremely distressed, says there's an ongoing bio event but doesn't elaborate.

[Protag] and buddy need to drive fast as shit from the Farm all the way into town, to the Citadel.

Possibly sees people transform into glass as they drive? Maybe even swerve to avoid hitting someone turned into glass in the middle of the road, but end up hitting someone else instead. Perhaps the car is wrecked and they both barely just survive. Perhaps one of them is slightly hurt, holding their shoulder.

Now we're somewhere on Amager, a few clicks out from the Citadel. Main goal is to get there to get briefed, but it becomes clear that everything is quickly getting all fucked up.

Idk where to go from here.

Perhaps you battle a few glass creatures, save a civilian or two, or at least try, and get picked up by a chopper or smth that takes you to da citadel.

You're informed that 1–2% (people with that rare blood type, maybe?) are immune. Other 50% of people turn into glass. Last 49% turn into monsters. Somerthing like that. Maybe only insane people or people with cluster B personality disorders turn into monsters. We'll see.

Goal of the game is then to track down who's responsible, find a cure? Maybe?

Game ends in some highrise tower on Amager where a phrama company is doing weird shit? Idk… Too generic?

Whole building could pulse red or something? Too Parasite Eve? Idk.

We'll work on it. For now, at least, I think this is _much_ better than nothing.

## Dialog Drafts

[PARTNER, teasing]
"You ever think they keep us out at The Farm so we don’t scare the interns?"

[PROTAG]
"Or maybe they just don’t trust us in the city anymore."

[PARTNER]
"God forbid we simulate a crisis somewhere with actual coffee."

*pause*

[PROTAG, sincere-ish]
"It’s been a while since anything's happened. That’s the part I hate. **It means something is coming soon.**"

---

[PARNER, shaken]
"That was [Section Chief]. He said—he said it’s happening."

Protag looks determined, as if asking “Details?”.

[PARTNER]
"He said bio event. He sounded… wrong."

[PROTAG]
"Okay. Then we floor it."

## Midway Point

Halfway through the game, our protags seek refuge in a small Metro maintenance room.

As they enter, there's a cutscene. They barely have a chance to sit down when a civilian starts banging on the door.

Franctic, screaming, “Open up! Help!!! I saw you run in there! Help me! They're coming!! OPEN UP!!!!! OPEN UP!!!!!”, banging the door.

[Partner] is giving [Protag] a look like “Don’t.”

[Protag] is just sitting there, slightly shaking with adrenaline, looking serious.

We hear the civilian outside the door either get killed by a Shardwalker or turn into one — exactly which is unclear.

The sound of glass fades.

Both [Protag] and [Partner] relax a little, but are still extremely on edge.

At one point, either now, or later in the morning, we get an exchange like this:

[PARTNER]
How is this happening? How can someone turn into glass?

[PROTAG]
I don't know...

[PARTNER]
Why is it only happening to some people, not us?

[PROTAG]
I don't know.

[PARTNER]
Why [something else or other]? Why???

[PROTAG]
I DON'T KNOW, DANNY! I DON'T KNOW! IT IS COMPLETELY FUCKED, YOU ARE RIGHT.
NOW LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

## Possible Later Scene

Protag is popping the trunk of the stranded car. There's not much in there.

[PROTAG]
Dan… Where’s the standard loadout?

[PARTNER]
I– I didn’t lack it. We’ve been at the farm all week. I—i—i didn’t pack it today.

[PROTAG]
Dan…

[PARTNER]
I— This is… I mean… This is not the— Look, I can go back there on foot and get whatever's in tha armory at the farm.

[PROTAG]
Dan…

[But perhaps instead, they find some random guns on the way and only get fully loaded once they reach the citadel, mid-game.]

## Alternate Name Ideas

- Glass Eden
- Reaping Fields, or Harvest Fields (like Amager)
