- Use our geometry types from `Sources/Rendering/Core/Geometry.swift`:
  - `Point`, `Size`, `Rect`

- Prefer these over ad-hoc tuples or custom structs for 2D UI/layout coordinates.

- Examples:
  - `func beginFrame(viewportSize: Size, scale: Float)`
  - `Image.draw(in: Rect(x: 24, y: 24, width: 64, height: 64))`
  - `let position = Point(100, 200)`
